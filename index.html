Hello, this is the website for my course blog for CSC148.

<em>SLOG 1</em>:

I've always been in favour of learning how to write well and of blending some study of the humanities into a technical education. It's been a personal goal as well as something I think most students—particularly "geeks," or students of science, computer science and mathematics—should strive towards.

First, communication skills are helpful in literally every aspect of work and life. Being well-spoken, well-read, and good at writing enhances your ability to communicate with, relate to, and convince others. And being able to work with people so as to maximize both your own and their productivity and usefulness is very much necessary for doing well. Although technical skill alone can bring you a considerable amount of success, I think that an inability to communicate is very likely to impose onto you a "professional ceiling" of sorts. Joel Spolsky comments extensively on concrete examples of programmers who became more successful than others because of their ability to write. Particularly in computer science and other sciences, where thorough training in writing is often not easily accessible or is even neglected, writing well is a rare trait that can make some "geeks" stand out from their peers.

A second, more personal reason for why I think writing is important is for self-development and broadening. I've always tried to avoid being "one-dimesional" in my academic interests. I value having some skill or expertise in areas outside of my specialty because I think it makes me a more varied person; it's not something I can really justify further than saying that it's a personal preference. But I also think that objectively, writing a lot helps you learn and understand yourself better. Putting down your thoughts, dilemmas, and meditations can help you first understand them better at the time, and second, get a better idea of how you were thinking when you later look back. I think that we misconstrue our feelings in the past more than we realize; writing down your thoughts as you have them gives you a more accurate idea of how you've changed your mind and grown over time.

The course content has been somewhat interesting thus far. The third week of lectures was the first one in which I felt like I genuinely absorbed concrete concepts (subclasses and inheritance, specifically). Some of the more abstract work involved in creating classes and subclasses has been a challenge for me—especially in writing the quizzes. I think the thing I need most is practice with programming, so I'm going to try to do more of the "additional exercises" in the labs next time.

Hello, this is the website for my course blog for CSC148.
</p>
<p>
<b>SLOG 1</b>:
<br>
I've always been in favour of learning how to write well and of blending some study of the humanities into a technical education. It's been a personal goal as well as something I think most students—particularly "geeks," or students of science, computer science and mathematics—should strive towards.
</p>
<p>
First, communication skills are helpful in literally every aspect of work and life. Being well-spoken, well-read, and good at writing enhances your ability to communicate with, relate to, and convince others. And being able to work with people so as to maximize both your own and their productivity and usefulness is very much necessary for doing well. Although technical skill alone can bring you a considerable amount of success, I think that an inability to communicate is very likely to impose onto you a "professional ceiling" of sorts. Joel Spolsky comments extensively on concrete examples of programmers who became more successful than others because of their ability to write. Particularly in computer science and other sciences, where thorough training in writing is often not easily accessible or is even neglected, writing well is a rare trait that can make some "geeks" stand out from their peers.
</p>
<p>
A second, more personal reason for why I think writing is important is for self-development and broadening. I've always tried to avoid being "one-dimesional" in my academic interests. I value having some skill or expertise in areas outside of my specialty because I think it makes me a more varied person; it's not something I can really justify further than saying that it's a personal preference. But I also think that objectively, writing a lot helps you learn and understand yourself better. Putting down your thoughts, dilemmas, and meditations can help you first understand them better at the time, and second, get a better idea of how you were thinking when you later look back. I think that we misconstrue our feelings in the past more than we realize; writing down your thoughts as you have them gives you a more accurate idea of how you've changed your mind and grown over time.

The course content has been somewhat interesting thus far. The third week of lectures was the first one in which I felt like I genuinely absorbed concrete concepts (subclasses and inheritance, specifically). Some of the more abstract work involved in creating classes and subclasses has been a challenge for me—especially in writing the quizzes. I think the thing I need most is practice with programming, so I'm going to try to do more of the "additional exercises" in the labs next time.

<b> SLOG 2 </b>:
<br>
There are a couple of things to reflect on from the past few weeks.
</p>
<p>
I came into this course without having taken CSC108 and without a strong programming background. I had only done a tiny bit of Java and C++ in high school, and so prepare for this class, I did the Python course on Codecademy over the winter break. My weak background definitely hindered me in the first few weeks. Though I understood the syntax we were using, I had very little experience actually writing code to solve problems (and was consequently also weak with documentation and style). But now I'm much more comfortable with both the conceptual and practical aspects of the course. I can't say there was a particular turning point at which things clicked; I just gradually got the hang of things with practice. That said, the first test is coming up and I haven't received a single quiz mark yet, so I can't be certain that I have a good grasp of things.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the initial struggles, I've enjoyed the work and the learning so far. One of the things I've really liked is how much being able to program just a bit empowers me to do some things far more quickly and efficiently. I used Python, for example, in part of my recent physics problem set—it would've been awful doing the required computations by hand or with a calculator. Another thing I've enjoy about computer science so far is the way that theory and practice seem to fit nicely together. The abstract concepts can be grounded very easily with concrete examples of code. I don't find that to be the case as much with something like math—the jump between theory and application feels a little less comfortable there. I think this feeling has to do with the fact that grounding mathematical concepts onto the physical world makes them seem a little less rigorous, while it doesn't feel like rigour is lost when applying computer science concepts to actual code (the code itself is still quite abstract).
</p>
<p>
Throughout this time I've been thinking about what I want to focus on for my degree. I came into the university of life sciences, and then was leaning for a while towards mathematics and physics, and most recently began to consider whether I can squeeze computer science into this setup. At this point, I'm pretty sure I'll be taking at least a few more computer science courses in the future (perhaps a minor or even a major), but something tells me that computer science ultimately won't be for me. There really hasn't been anything in particular that has continued to bother me, but I guess at the same time I haven't been drawn into it with a ton of excitement.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of excitement though, the stuff about recursion and Turtle graphics is actually really cool. I'm going to try to look into that more and start making fractal-like graphics.
